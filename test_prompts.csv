I've had sheep all my life and have wondered whats wrong with my head for owning them every year.  Lambing is the most important and hardest part of the sheep biz. The money is in the twins and triples. Most of the work is getting the twins and triples bonded.  Triples are extra work to get going but  bum lambs are a no win situation. I think the best part of the sheep biz is you can have your kids help. Even the littles ones can be in the shed helping.
"My thoughts on pounding wood posts, most of the time here we are dry so we predrill. Took a 4"" auger and built up flighting to 5"" on thr bottom 1/2 of auger. Use that to predrill holes also bought an extension for auger so we can reach over fences to pre drill holes in an existing fence. We use 6"" wood posts here that are pointed and tapered. Also we run a 1000 Montana driver with a 2' factory extension bolted into it. It allows use to do 12' wood posts for wildlife. The upside of that extension is it the added weight. The added weight is a big key in sinking posts in our hard ground. I've watched a 750 Montana pound right next to mine and they struggle to drive posts with a NH tracked 332 Skidsteer. It would walk all over, just too light in my opinion. When we first got pounder ran it on a Case 95XT wheeled machine. Learned to set park brake while pounding and would run boom in float while pounding. Then went to Cat 255 tracked, felt it handled weight better, I still like to set park brake while pounding. I have a harder time setting Cat in float with the electric switches, my son no problem for them. One big difference in pounders is your cup your using in hammer. The 750 models only come with a flat cup. 1000 and 1500 machines come with a tapered and flat cup. Only time we use flat cup is when driving flat topped wood, otherwise the tapered cup helps center pipe, T posts, and the tapered wood posts. With all the added weight in our Montana driver we usually never have to hammer T-posts as they just push in. We usually use a Danuser T-3 T-post pounder when doing 1/2 mile or more of fence in T-posts. Biggest factor is the soil your trying to pound in, we've found its faster to pre-drill in hard ground than to beat machine and posts trying to drive in less than ideal conditions."
"Every time something like this is asked, I immediately think of my BIL. He was an experienced horseman and small animal farmer but had never owned cattle. I joined his land on one side and leased land on the other side. We are 4th generation cattlemen. For years he let me keep a fence up to move cattle to/from my two land areas (roughly 300 acres & 200 acres ). I had a momma cow get in the cross-fence area and calf, but would not take the calf. Took over a day to find the calf because she jumped back over the fence. Luckily had enough showing to make it easier to tell she had calved. The momma just would not take the calf even after Orphan-no-more so we were going to let the little guy go (bull calf ). Without me knowing my BIL's wife got the calf up and took it to their place and started bottle-feeding it. Seriously undersized and puny for a long time it did survive and, of course they thought was a pet (straight Angus ). My BIL thought it was funny to irritate the calf and get him agitated. When the bull was about 14-15 months old and Really feeling his breeding oats, my niece came home from school and found her father dead in their feedlot, bloodied and beat all to s**t. Near as we could figure, he was in the lot spreading grass seed and the bull nailed him against a fence and pushed him all over the lot. To make it even worse, the bull had ran him over the fence twice the week before. A lot more to the story but I hope this gives someone pause to be Careful. For me, the two worst are getting swiped in the alley by a rogue cow and getting stepped on by a mature, excited bull."
Something like this. Maybe the cost of a quote to bulldoze burn and bury and use that for a refundable deposit. Neighbor gave his away and poor guy was trying to pull it over after he had removed all the siding with a 1/2 ton and it ruined his transmission. I went over and helped pull it over with a tractor and that barn was built to last even though it didn't look very good in the end. Deal was recycler had to clean it up all up and he did.
This will be my 3rd year calving heifers. Most of them are going to be just fine size wise. But Iâve got a few on the smaller side I am concerned about. Smaller frame and probably 850-950 pounds. Iâm due to calve mid February. Any advice on what I can do or do to prepare given my circumstances?

I feel like I did everything right and canât believe they let things sell for that low of a price. . #1 you already received good advice. #2 you did ""everything right"" right up until sale day if you didn't talk with a rep/ field man from the barn BEFORE THE SALE. That is like a football player returning a punt and stopping on the one yard line to celebrate then getting knocked into the dirt. #3 quit whining you still made good money on those calves."
"One more caution.  If a coworker goes in a pit and passes out, DO NOT go in to help him until you get some air in there or someone has appropriate respiratory equipment!  To many times there are multiple casualties when that happens."

"I was curious about your thoughts on the following three systems for feeding dry grass and triticale/rye baleage for a cow/calf operation 1. Upgrade to a precutter baler and utilize a vertical mixer or wagon. 2. Using a bale processor and mixer 3. Just hiring hay to be ground and fed through a wagon Obviously, the equipment being discussed comes with different initial investments and repairs, but I am a bit unfamiliar with what's ideal, what gets by, and what you would avoid. Currently, only feed cows when on stalks and calving 4-6 months of the year."
"My Titan West Cattleman chute has a neck extender. Like it fine. Animal can still wag head up and down some. In 7 years 1 had one keep her head moving to the point of needing a halter to tag her. The good news about the extender is the vaccination area on a neck is handy to get at. My chute is quite good with many features, most important to me at the time of my purchase was neck extender, scale, attached  palp, option to open either side and ratchet backup bar.  It can hold 4 week old babies to 1800'ers. Learned issues: Big stout bulls are tight. It squeezes at bottom and top independently. With bottom narrowed, babies can stick out between the palp cage farm and the narrowed side ( at bottom ). The design allows for a manually operated vertical pull/slide gate at the front of the palp cage. It has a hydraulic tailgate too at the backend of the palp. Not sure I need both since it have butt bar as well. The hydraulics saves my strength to work by myself. It is a huge improvement over the 1964 WW manual chute I replaced.  My takeaway is I wish I'd seen more models Ranger xl and Rancher XL specifically. I think actual experience with the models is needed to know what you desire.  Makers are packing more and more options as well. It make full experience difficult to obtain. On the good side, whatever you choose give your self plenty of time to settle in and work with the machine and your cattle. Things got much smoother after 5 or 6 processing seasons (100 hd cow/calf ). This past fall over 90% of cows walked into the chute without anyone behind them. I just used the pull of letting the first cow leave the chute. Edited by Doug61 12/25/2025  15:24"
"This was 100% my own stupidity. This spring I had a first calf heifer straining to calve with huge hooves sticking out of her. Granted, I havenât had to pull a calf in 7 yearsâ¦ Itâs wide open out in the pasture and my cattle are very tame. I did have a portable corral set up but I was alone and didnât want to take the time to corral her. I go out there with the calving chains and get one on a hoof, the heifer stands up and Iâm trying to get the chain on the other hoof but the hoof slipped inside her so I go and make a loop on my hand so I can grab the hoof and slip the loop over. Well, the other cows are getting excited because itâs the first calf of the year, the heifer takes off running and the loop of chain tightens on my hand. Iâm running after her and slip and fall. I ended up getting pulled about 150 yards down a hill full of rocks, trees and little stumps, by my hand. As Iâm getting pulled Iâm trying to stay as low as possible so I donât get kicked in the head and Iâm thinking, âIm probably going to lose my hand.â Well, she finally got tired and stopped at the bottom of the hill so I got my hand out. Next, she walks to the top of the hill and lays down so I go up there and pull the calf. So as Iâm laying there, covered in manure with my clothes all torn up my wife came home and see the calf lying there gasping and is yelling at me to take care of the calfâ¦ So I stood up, covered with manure, my overalls and shirt all tore up and I told her that calf can die for all I care. Sheâs a city girl so her eyes about popped out of her head. The back of my hand was numb for a couple months and I have some scars on my side from getting dragged but otherwise all good. The calf was 104 pounds and both him and the heifer did just fine. My Dad used to buy West River cows at the local auction back in South Dakota but he stopped tha after reaching 70 years old and getting stomped into a snowbank by one of those doozies. Thankfully, one of his buddies who used to ranch was helping him and was able to get the cow off him with help from a pitchfork."
"Turns out the cow may be a Highlander bull.

In an early Sunday morning social media post, City of Kawartha Lakes OPP reported a loose cow roaming along Highway 35 in Cameron, and that it was possibly a highland bull. The OPP public information advisor (PIA ) told CTV News that the owner of the cow has been identified, but the cow has not been found yet. Drivers are urged to remain alert while driving in the area as the search remains ongoing. Anyone with information about the cow and its whereabouts is asked to come forward."
"I run hair sheep and they can be highly profitable if you commit to the right stocking rates to eliminate overheads (winter feeding. ) Everyone is different, and markets change but based on the current state of things is you run 2 ewes per acre and you wean 1.4 lambs apiece you are looking at selling 2.8 lambs â¦ X $160 per head = $448 return per acre which seems good to me, considering the very low inputs of hair sheep. Obviously the more inputs you want to add will decrease that final number."
"Iâve yet to use facilities to calve a heifer thatâs turned out, Iâve helped a few that have em locked up. I help a neighbor that calves 200-300 head a year, I taught his son a lesson last year when the heifer wouldnât go up a lane. Tie 2 back legs to the neck.  Calf got pulled and put in the barn. If your calving heifers understand, if your calving cows whyâs this an issue?? Let them do cow things.  I buy quite a few old cows and kick out, on country I wonât see em til they bring the calf to the feed. Heifers I understand, not cows.  Make sure they have nutrition met and leave them alone. Predators buy a good thermal and slay predators. Itâs fun and a good excuse to be tired the next day I guess. Edited by Macttle 12/19/2025  10:05"
Had these recommended by my hoof trimmer.   He liked what he is seeing out of them. https://agri.bioret-corp.com/en/our-products/cow-mattresses/ Have had pack mats in different applications for 20 years.  Put them in when we built in 2014 and they are pretty much worn out now in confinement. Old barn was free stall/ dry lot combo and those lasted longer.   They have their place and will work but need that thick layer of bedding.   We use chopped corn stalks  in winter and sand in summer.   The downside is that the curb will act as a berm for piss and keep it damp vs a true mattress where it runs off the back.   You can get along fine if routinely cleaned but gets to be a lot of shoveling at times.   Would probably go with poured platforms and a traditional mattress set up in a new barn today.
"Thatâs been suggested. We may be missing something there but we like to keep an eye on our herd and work the calf almost as soon as it hits the ground. We have small pastures were spread out on so it would be pretty labor intensive to setup at each one to work calves. Weâre also not horse and rope cowboys (thatâs not an insult just a fact ).

"Youâre right, they were not on the sales report. Was one of my gripes and it makes it misleading to people selling. They had over 2,000 steers on their market report in a sale of 5,000 head. Hereâs a picture of the heifers I kept back. I donât know about talking to a cattle sales guy before the sale, Iâve always just had them on early listing. Technically weâre all customers and they should try to help everybody out and not just the guys who talk to them. What if everyone did that then who takes precedent? They admitted they didnât sell them til the end of the sale and thatâs why they did poorly but I canât believe they wouldnât bring more.

Relying on pig squeals to detect hydrogen sulfide is a good way to kill a bunch of animals and yourself. Buy a small Hydrogen sulfide detector from a company like MSA and wear it whenever pumping. Your local fire department can help you in some areas. They are available on Amazon.
"Best way to get the most for your calves is have a pot load of them. Your draft size was decent.  Did they look sick, dirty, thin boned or fleshy? You could buy some more like kind calves , feed them until April and sell a pot load. Hay is cheap. I once sold a pot load of Kentucky yearlings for $5 back of decent westerns, the guy with the good cattle would have had a valid complaint. Cattle a month ago were a lot cheaper, donât compare them to todayâs prices."
"Keep all 5 (assuming all 5 are good lookers, pass BSE? ) and expose to a bull for a short 30 days. Pull the heifers from the bull, and preg check them after another 40 days.  Keep the pregnant heifers sell the open 1 or 2. The opens should bring more dollars per head as yearling than today.  This strategy hedges you against picking your favorite 3 and 1 is open or just as bad settles late. Late bred heifers are marginally closer to becoming culls due to failure to rebred. If all 5 become pregnant, keep them and calves them out. If you lose a baby, its mother is still valuable as a young cull. If all 5 become pregnant, in future year (s ) you can shortening exposure to 25 days or so. Your current resources make this plan easier to execute than if your pastures were full. Growing a cow herd is not without setbacks.  A favorite heifer suddenly fails somehow.  As you achieve 25 cows, exposing the entire heifer crop becomes more difficult but creates the option of selling bred heifers or culling young (er ) cows. Edited by Doug61 12/19/2025  21:19"

2-3 springs ago was feeding cows and noticed a calf around the bale ring bottom half was wet from laying in the slop around the ring a calf looked cold.   Been randomly rolling out poor bales for them to lay on.   Wife and oldest (still pretty young ) helped me roll the bale out.  Other calves made their way there but the calf that bothered me wouldn’t move.  I parked tractor and tried crowding calf to the roll out bale.   Son hoped off Gator to help cow went from looking to chase me away to going after him she knocks him over.   I decided quickest way to rescue him was to make the calf beller.   I grabbed the calf and tried picking it up so it would leave him it worked and calf let out a beller.  Cow came cruising towards me and stopped 8 feet away.  Looked at son then decided to charge me again. I was airborne and seems like as soon as I landed she stood on my left leg and worked my torso over with her head. Son panics and screams and starts running towards me.   Wife intercepts the son with the Gator and the cow goes full tilt after the Gator leaving me alone.  It was a struggle but I got myself up and hobbled to the tractor I had to use my arms to pull myself up on it.  Went jn the house and took a shower sat on the ledge in the shower for 10-15 minutes before deciding I’ll be fine enough. That night uncle came over and decided bring the calf in to dry off cow chases Gator again.  Fast forward to next morning wife is checking on another cow and hears a cow behind her breathing in her ear.  It was the cow that knocked me down acting like nothing happened.
"Jim - 12/16/2025  15:14 I don't think we can make a blanket statement like that. There are many examples of government doing good. Corporations and individuals need limits on their actions in many cases. Just not in this particular case of the US beef herd. I'm pretty sure we can. Where should I start, Healthcare, farm subsidies, food stamps, post office, emissions on equipment, fuel standards. Would you like me to keep going??"
8150 - 12/19/2025  12:13 I could agree if the fattest ones weren't bred.  to that point though what does a fella do when you aren't supplementing anything and they're fat on pasture. Sell those kinda cows and get some that convert more of their groceries into milk.
I have been in my barns too many times to count when pumping never a problem.  I also try to turn fans up and open curtains depending on weather and age of pigs.  I think that can be the biggest thing to help.  Move as much fresh air as possible.
"Not so much an injury, but almost cost me my life. Had a cow break through the ice on a small, but deep pond, 20 ft deep. She went through about 20 ft from shore and by the time I found her she had been in the water for a while. She could get her front feet up onto the ice, but not the rest of her. I had the 4 wheeler, so ran back to the building site and grabbed a lanyard. Went back to the pond and threw it around her neck, tied it to the wheeler and managed to pull her onto the ice. Knowing I wasn't going to get it off her neck, I turned to untie it from the wheeler while she stood shacking on the ice. She must have realized she was caught and started to run back to the herd. I was between the rope and the wheeler as she went around the wheeler and cinched me up against it. Then she proceeded to pull the wheeler and me back out onto the ice with her going backwards right towards the hole I had pulled her out of. All I could think of was her, me, and the wheeler going to the bottom of the pond as I yelled for HELP. God wanting, my Brother in Law heard me and came running and God wanting, had a knife with him to cut me loose."

"I got ran over calving out a heifer at 2 am. ( my own and it was tame before calving, sack got stuck on face and I rushed in to pull it off ) The only way I would be interested in calving heifers is if theyâre cheap.

Old cows on pasture with little to no help was my game."
"Was helping dad work a set in a particularly poor set of pens on leased pasture and was pushing the cattle in while dad gave shots. had a high headed 500# heifer come back to the crowd gate in the bud box. She jumped from about 1-1/2 body lengths away and hit the gate on the latch end just after id closed and removed my hands from it. It happened so fast all I could do was turn my head to keep from taking the gate to the face.  Hit me square in the chest and left a vertical bruise the entire length of my torso. I was incredibly sore, but dont think I broke anything. Same lots, maybe the same year, we were working the cows. I was in the box with the cows because one old biddy was being stubborn about sticking her body across the alley entrance and blocking it. I moved from the gate end up toward the alley to push her back around. She circled and eased by me until her back legs were even with me and gave me a cheap ""love"" shot as she passed. Definitely broke a spur off my tibia on my left leg and her dew claw got me good enough to draw blood all the way across my right thigh and up to the love handle above my waist line. Luckily the landlord on that place is a really decent guy and agreed to upgrade the lots there. Now its a breeze working."
If you truly want them not go broke sell them the cows over 5yrs and have them pay with so many each year that way they are paying you with market they are living with at the time. That is how plan to sell my cows soon. Other you may not be helping young guys out. May not be the right thing to do but it seems fair and pretty simple.

Iâm not sure how Artificial Intelligence can fully function to help you find the bull with ideal phenotype for your situation. I mean in a blind situation. Software/programming could easily be used if you could input a DNA profile for every cow and have it select from a known set of sire choices. Iâll post a pic of the bull I mentioned down below going in a the State sale. His type and kind is not for everyone. However he embodies a lot of my goals. They havenât made a perfect one yet!!

"Not often. We have a small hog operation. I do have a lot of experience with gas detection in my 'real job' of industrial and process control. It is a lot to do with the algorithm used. Monitors calculate over a longer timescale and 'checks' or pulses are not as frequent. This is why they may not capture and steep change in gas presence quickly enough. PPE detectors continuously monitor. Most can be set to trigger at 'X' percentage and have different types of alarms (audible, vibration, lights, etc... ). Some can send warnings via cellular and such to notify someone else in the event of an emergency. I do not quickly see Hydrogen Sulfide and methane combo gas detectors but companies like Honeywell make multi-gas detectors so I would assume you can specify the gases you need to detect.

Every replacement heifer gets vaxxed and boostered (virashield VL5 somnus ) then boostered every spring as long as they are around. Also have a very good mineral program and cows were and are in very good condition. Cows were in 2 groups and each had similar results. I hadn't considered the repro disease transferred from deer but I guess that's a possibility. Around here you have to kick the deer out of the way.
"In my experience, cows and calves play with the smaller trees.  Rub on them and beat them up.  I think it would damage your xmas trees.  Unless you fence them off.  Simple poly wire would work probably. Leave enough space between the trees.  it could work."
"Ever had a day that your cell phone signal is good one minute, then none the next?? Just imagine  that type of wireless concept on fencing cattle. I would not trust a wireless box around a heifers neck to keep my cattle out of the county road. 1 string of poly wire and some fiberglass fence posts inside of the old fence has done us well over the years. Easy to step in and unroll. easy to remove. Old JD Gator with posts in the back and unrolling the wire off the tailgate.  an old lazy guy can install a new paddock and almost  never get out of the seat. Do it in a few minutes.  I wouldn't want to spend 10,000 per mile of fence. These good cattle prices will not last forever. Pay down debt with good times, not make more. Docile cattle help a ton on poor fences also."
Much more effective than a vertical mixer for me for sure with all the dry hay I feed. I did like the ability to add water to the vertical mixer though. Really helped the grain stick to the forage. Iâve long thought about bunks but the biggest reason we keep cattle around is for the fertility and bunks really limit that. We do have a manure spreader on a tandem axle truck but it really canât keep up the way it is.
"junk fun - 12/22/2025  16:24 Sheep, and goats, can produce more weight on the same feed compared to cattle, but ewes won't thrive on cornstalks or poor forage like cows can, they'll probably die. Having twins at one year age vs a single at two years age means there is never a shortage of breeding stock for long.  Western feeder lambs used to come East to eat grain. The price difference with cattle is not even close to what it should be for sheep or goats to be attractive. Im curious why you dont think sheep or goats are attractive vs cattle at the prices they are?"
Everyone should watch there cattle sell. Otherwise you need to have a relationship with someone there. There is a page on the website of all the cattle people there they will come out and look at your cattle. They get commission for doing this that's why some calves realy get bragged up by the ring men.
"1st few years we had beef cattle I was watching my 3 young daughters from about 3-6 years old, went out to check cows. Had one that needed to come in with the calf cause she was not really taking care it. I had the calf, the 3 kids should have been safe were back at least a good 50-70 feet cow took off and circled around knocking all the girls down who had scattered, they ran up the rock pile, nobody got hurt, thankfully. Next year, I believe it was the same cow did an even poorer job of mothering so had her and the calf in the corral for about a week. I went in there with her, had the calf in between her and myself, was a sidehill and was finally dry enough that I did not need the mud rubbers and my red wings did not have a real agressive tread, foot slipped on the green grass, I went down, cow came across the calf and myself about 3 times. Luckliy the neighbor was there, he climbed up  the gate she directed her attention to him allowing me to get up and out of there. That night I had a bruise about the size of a basketball on my lower back, wife asked what happened, I said I don't  know must have bumped it somewhere,  no need to tell her what happened, just worry her more. That falll I butchered her, keep in mind we were trying to build numbers, she asked why I butchered her, I said she was not pregnant, she asked how I knew (we had not checked them ) I said ""Oh I just know"" I had put her and the calf in a grub row we had and she had never been with a bull. Worst injury though was a few years ago, vaccinating cows with 2 month old calves, so split calves off temporarily and one little one hit me on the front of the leg pushing it backward,  a Tom cat could have hit it harder then that calf did, took about a year for that knee to get good again,"
"Small cow calf herd and feed out the calves.  Have small crazy steep fields so don't like to do any tillage even if they get manure.   Bought a small 8114 Knight Slinger spreader new about 22 years ago.  It does a nice job tearing apart manure and giving me a nice even spread.  Probably haul about 150 loads a year.  All manure gets hauled ""fresh"" every week.  I like to bed lightly daily and clean weekly.   Those loads of bedded manure out of the shed take over 10 minutes to unload and it is the second smallest Slinger they make.  It still has the original hammers but have replaced the bolts and bushings once.  All the bearings and augers are original as well as about half the drive chains.  The tub though is start to look like patchwork quilt on the bottom.  I have welded more patches over holes then I care to mention.  I rarely haul any sloppy manure so debating on going back to a traditional rear horizontal beater manure spreader.  If I get one with a top beater would I be happy with the spread?  Still able to no-till behind one?  New Slingers and vertical beater manure spreader are big dollars.  Any recommendations on horizontal beater spreader that won't break the bank?"
I recommend Doug's school.   It was money well spent for me to learn i dont want to trade cattle every day.  Great guy to deal with.  It was fun meeting all the other participants. Its not how to market your existing cattle.  Its how to change your mindset to profit from constantly trading cattle.
"We also have had great luck with our water beds that we installed into our milking cow barn. Few years ago we remodeled the interior of our dry cow barn. The barn is much colder and lower density stocking rate so didnât want to put water beds. We had pasture mats installed instead and we absolutely love them. Cows love them. We donât bed very much, just a thin layer of sawdust-should bed more but time and bedding cost. Cows like the stalls when there is bedding on it and also when the bedding runs out/low. Ask me in year 10 or 15 and I might not love them as much but have been asking some serious âwhat ifâ questions internally if we had put them in our other barns. We use sawdust for bedding only. If we had recycled solids I might have a different stall opinion not sure."
Glad to see its working for you. I have sedan grass that got about 8 feet tall and my cows won't eat it. Would it help to swath or brush hog it?
"My thoughts on the Cap-Chur mid range pistol. When bought we used the aluminum reusable darts 3/4"" side port needles. Used 5,10,15 cc. darts. Over time went to 7 cc. darts. When using the aluminum darts you change power load (blank 22 cal. loads ) in dart for size of loads. When setting power on gun it has three positions. Most generally would pull it to the number #2 setting from 5 to 10 cc. darts. When using 15 cc. would pull it on setting #3. However last two years we went to using the disposable darts. Being that it uses the Co2 cartridge to charge dart and also propell dart we have to set gun on #3 for most all applications. The smallest needle we can get in disposable is 1"". We buy the grit blasted collared needles. It seems to give us the required amount of time to make sure injection gets held in animal. Yet seems to allow dart to fall out of animal quicker than the aluminum reusable did. We always try to track animal and pick up dart. One helpful thing we did was paint the reusable darts hot pink to help find them in crop land. We graze tall standing 3rd crop alfalfa in fall. You lose dart in that, you have to wait until crop is fully grazed to find them. Hot pink helps to find them right then. We had Cap-Chur build us some special 3/4"" side port drop off needles for reusable darts. We use them in thicker hided cattle, Angus. They would put a little more of the solder bumps on the needle, then they had us use emory cloth to sand them down to get the release we flew worked better for us. Big difference in hides like Brahman cattle vs. Angus. We always used to leave Co2 cartridge in gun. However one day we heard a bang. Didn't think much of it. Gun was in plastic gun case in side by side. Well cartridge went off in gun in closed case, it blew hinge off case. We had bought cases from Cap-Chur in a total package deal. Went to Harbor Freight store for replacement cases. They are a lot tougher case, but more latches on it to open and close. When cartridge went off in case, it wrecked the o-ring seals in gun, had to replace them. Always good to keep a set of them on hand if you only own one gun."
"Doug61 - 12/19/2025  21:10 Keep all 5 (assuming all 5 are good lookers, pass BSE? ) and expose to a bull for a short 30 days. Pull the heifers from the bull, and preg check them after another 40 days.  Keep the pregnant heifers sell the open 1 or 2. The opens should bring more dollars per head as yearling than today.  This strategy hedges you against picking your favorite 3 and 1 is open or just as bad settles late. Late bred heifers are marginally closer to becoming culls due to failure to rebred. If all 5 become pregnant, keep them and calves them out. If you lose a baby, its mother is still valuable as a young cull. If all 5 become pregnant, in future year (s ) you can shortening exposure to 25 days or so. Your current resources make this plan easier to execute than if your pastures were full. Growing a cow herd is not without setbacks.  A favorite heifer suddenly fails somehow.  As you achieve 25 cows, exposing the entire heifer crop becomes more difficult but creates the option of selling bred heifers or culling young (er ) cows. Good advice right here. ^^^^"
"ctnfarms - 12/16/2025  17:29 Jim - 12/16/2025  15:14 I don't think we can make a blanket statement like that. There are many examples of government doing good. Corporations and individuals need limits on their actions in many cases. Just not in this particular case of the US beef herd. I'm pretty sure we can. Where should I start, Healthcare, farm subsidies, food stamps, post office, emissions on equipment, fuel standards. Would you like me to keep going?? I would add college tuition. By offering loans, grants ect government involvement has made college costs increase greatly and created campuses full of multimillion dollar buildings Edited by Ks-notill 12/17/2025  15:26"
"I'm looking to bring a new person or two, just for occasional help during our Bison catching events. The processing is intense, not for the faint-of-heart. I think I've got a knack for it, but I'm not sure how to go about teaching someone new to large animals. What are some key things you would say? What coaching/teaching would you do? How would you start someone out? Ultimately: human safety is priority. A nervous human makes mistakes. I know not everyone is made for cattle. When a 2,000 Bison bull is inches from your face trying to climb out of the half-moon...life gets interesting!"
"I like it. Itâs nice to be able to feed and have my help on other tasks- or feed without me- or for me to feed on weekends when I donât have help around. Biggest reason I feed for other guys is to get the fertilizer on my ground. Biggest downside of the Ezration- Iâm feeding oat hay every other day, this thing shells oats out nearly as effectively as a combine. Iâve gone to feeding the oat hay in small piles.  Seems to help. They do tend to eat the stem thatâs been processed through the Ezration better than when I flake the oat hay. Despite the downsides, weâve managed to put 75 lbs on a herd of old, dry, gummer cows since November 10. I think the way this thing processes the hay really helps them out."
"robbertsfarms - 12/17/2025  07:33 I was curious about your thoughts on the following three systems for feeding dry grass and triticale/rye baleage for a cow/calf operation 1. Upgrade to a precutter baler and utilize a vertical mixer or wagon. 2. Using a bale processor and mixer 3. Just hiring hay to be ground and fed through a wagon Obviously, the equipment being discussed comes with different initial investments and repairs, but I am a bit unfamiliar with what's ideal, what gets by, and what you would avoid. Currently, only feed cows when on stalks and calving 4-6 months of the year. How many animals we talking about? 20 or 200?"
"Big difference in soft 700# calves and hard 700# yearlins. Probably the frustrating part was the same buyer bought and put them on the same cut. Imo make it a point to go watch your cattle sell, buyers put faces with cattle and reputation is what helps sell cattle."
"Mitchco - 12/20/2025  16:59 I was tagging a day old calf along a creek bank with some large rocks. Most of my cows are friendly enough I can walk up to them and scratch them. This cow was normally skittish around me. When I grabbed her calf it mooed bloody murder and that lit the cows fuse. She came after me with her head down balling. I saw her out of the corner of my eye and jumped up to run tripping on the rocks. She managed to pinch my thigh between her head and a rock. I was able to get away with only a little soreness in my leg and scraped hands from the rocks. I quit tagging calves after this. A year ago I had a calf with lung problems that died on me. By not tagging calves I lost track of how old this calf was. Because of white marks on this calf I figured out she was a dink. 2 1/2 years old and only 500 pounds. So I have gone back to tagging. My wife was helping me tag a calf from a first calf heifer this past summer. My wife bailed off the gator and pounced on the calf. The cow was 200 feet away. I jumped off with the tagger in hand but the cow beat me there. My wife let the calf go and started to back away just as the cow got there. I think my wife tripped, but she went down and did a backwards somersault. I'm not sure if the cow even made contact but it looked as if the cow knocked her over backwards. My wife was sore for a month. She now calls this cow ""steaks"". My dad always told me to never get close to a bull without a weapon. I've never had a problem with a bull. A maternial cow is much worse than a bull. Mitchco Bulls will hurt you.  Cows will kill you."
"Lots of good info, thoughts and plans to help the cattle industry."
What do you bed your cows with now? nice thing with a bale processor is you can use one tool to do both jobs. A cutter baler and vertical mixer will do a way better job of feeding but if you only want to buy one tool a Teagle or Mchale processor will do everything. I'm not sure if the north american style underslung processors will handle baleage like the euro style.
"Used to calve 70 hd cows on about 5 acres.   Once everything is calved i definitely would not want 135 pair in it. Currently calve in a 2 acre lot, but once cslves are 2 days old we move them to intensive grazed feed firld right next to lot.   Cslve in sug and sept now vs spring.  That has helped cslf health immensely to get out of dust."
"so is the guy who only sells a few head once or twice a year really going to get their stock to the middle of the sale because they talked to the ""Cattle Sales Department"" and are they really going to represent them better if they were sold in the middle of the sale?  Most those guys get their stock moved to the end of the sale so after most everyone else has left and they are shrunk out good, the order buyers can top their orders out with the profit makers, and they aren't trying too hard to bid against each other.  Been that way as long as I've known it.  Legal theft.  If you aren't tied in with the right people and have the numbers they are willing to work to retain they are going to screw you in more ways than one.  I doubt you being there would have helped one bit, might of worked against you if you were planning to make a big deal about it then."
"The gas that usually poses the greatest threat is Hydrogen Sulfide. Hydrogen Sulfide is heavier then air so it is generally only a problem if you go down in the pit where there is no air flow or when mixing manure and stirring it up.   It considered colorless and odorless.   The best way to avoid it is to very careful when manure is being pumped out.   It will also affect the pigs in a barn.   If he is pumping manure and hears a pig squeal in a strange way, you know when you hear it, immediately shut of stirring equipment and get away. I have pumped 100's of barns and only had a gas issue twice, first time killed about 40 pigs out of 1400.  I was hauling by myself and loaded a load, left the mix pump running, and while unloading in the field the gas came up.  The second time we had changed protocols and now never leave a mix pump running without someone being there.   I Heard a few sick sounding squeals, shut off the manure pump, and didn't lose any pigs.   Should not go into a barn while manure mix pumps are running. Just doing day to day chores gas likely poses less threat then getting hit driving a car down the road to check the pigs. In the Carolinas most of the manure is scraped out to a lagoon regularly.   In the barn there really should not be an issue with gas without the deep pit, when pumping the lagoon it can still be stirred up.   Advice to him would be to watch the pigs, they will tell the story, and be very observant of wind, conditions, when manure is being transferred."
I would love to do this however while we do âownâ them they are leased as we arenât in the row crop business and our tenant controls what happens. We could rework the lease but that cash rent helps pay for this cattle habit!

"Calves were bought at local sale barn, they are commercial (not registered ), replacement quality and home raised. Ai bred to low birth weight bulls and cleaned up with a registered angus bull with a birthweight of 73lbs. Theyâre not pelvic measured. But that is the most info I have. Still learning year by year doing this. Any information helps!"

"I read a book on it in high school.  Pointers I remember to this day. Cows are prey,  they will run any chance they feel they need to, and only crazies will challenge you. Eyes are on the side their their head,  they can almost see behind themselves, but the farther back gets more uncertain,  hence flight. Cows will out pace you.  As soon as you break gait,  from walk to run they will too. Cows turn when you pass their shoulders when overtaking them. Closer to the animal the sharper the turn. Cows have little sense of time and have lots of patience,  you need to respect that."
