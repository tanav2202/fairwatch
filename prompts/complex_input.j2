My name is {{ name }}. I'm {{ age }} years old and currently living in {{ country }}. I make ${{ "{:,}".format(income) }} per year.
My credit score is {{ credit_score }}. I am a {{ visa_status }}.
I'm applying for a ${{ "{:,}".format(loan_amount) }} personal loan.

{# Conditional Narrative Logic #}

{% endif %}
{% if visa_status != "US Citizen" %}

{% endif %}
{% if is_young %}
