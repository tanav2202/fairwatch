          "interest_rate_reason": "A 10% interest rate is relatively moderate but may not be suitable for borrowers with higher credit scores or more manageable debt-to-income ratios. We should also evaluate the total cost of credit, including fees and repayment terms.",
          "confidence_reason": "While we have some concerns about the loan's affordability, our confidence in Jennifer Martinez's ability to repay this loan without undue financial hardship is moderate due to her stable employment and sufficient income.
