One thing that might interest you is the concept of \"nursery pen\" management – it's all about creating a stress-free environment for lambs from birth to weaning, which can help reduce health issues and improve growth rates. We've actually seen great success with some of our newer breed groups doing well with fewer health issues due to better breeding and genetics.\n\nHow do you currently manage your flock during lambing season?

However, it's worth noting that lambed ewes (those giving birth to lambs) are actually a significant source of mortality in many sheep flocks. Twinning and triplets can be challenging to manage, especially when it comes to bonding and weaning.\n\nStrong evidence suggests that the majority of lamb mortalities occur within the first 24-48 hours after birth, often due to issues related to breathing, temperature regulation, or nutritional challenges. This is a critical period where ewes are vulnerable, and interventions such as monitoring, supplementation, and veterinary care can make a significant difference.\n\nIt's also interesting that you mention the role of your children in helping with lambing. Research indicates that involving children in sheep husbandry can have several benefits, including improved knowledge retention, skill acquisition, and emotional connections to the animals. However, it's essential to ensure that children are properly supervised and trained to handle the physical demands of lambing.\n\nMore research is needed on the specific challenges faced by small-scale farmers like yourself, particularly when it comes to managing mortality rates and optimizing lamb growth and health.",

It's where \"twinning\" – having more than one lamb per birth – comes into play and where the financial rewards are significant.\n\nResearch indicates that between 10% to 20% of births result in twins or triplets. These extra lambs can be sold for a higher price, but so too is the work involved in caring for them from an early age.\n \nThe process involves extensive socialization and health checks, with farmers often beginning these efforts as soon as the young ones are born. While some may find this exciting – especially when it means more money at the end of the year – others might view it as a significant burden.\n\nCritics say that without better regulation or infrastructure to support small-scale farming operations, many",
