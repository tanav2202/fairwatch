      "so is the guy who only sells a few head once or twice a year really going to get their stock to the middle of the sale because they talked to the \"Cattle Sales Department\" and are they really going to represent them better if they were sold in the middle of the sale?  Most those guys get their stock moved to the end of the sale so after most everyone else has left and they are shrunk out good, the order buyers can top their orders out with the profit makers, and they aren't trying too hard to bid against each other.  Been that way as long as I've known it.  Legal theft.  If you aren't tied in with the right people and have the numbers they are willing to work to retain they are going to screw you in more ways than one.  I doubt you being there would have helped one bit, might of worked against you if you were planning to make a big deal about it then.",
      "In my experience, cows and calves play with the smaller trees.  Rub on them and beat them up.  I think it would damage your xmas trees.  Unless you fence them off.  Simple poly wire would work probably. Leave enough space between the trees.  it could work.",
      "Reading this post made me think back when I was a kid we had a local butcher shop that would drive their old winch truck out to the farm, shoot the animal of choice, hang it on the winch truck, gut it and haul it back to town to be processed. That was in the late 50's -early 60's. That must have been done to code considering dad lived to be 94 and mom is still alive at 98.",
      "I read a book on it in high school.  Pointers I remember to this day. Cows are prey,  they will run any chance they feel they need to, and only crazies will challenge you. Eyes are on the side their their head,  they can almost see behind themselves, but the farther back gets more uncertain,  hence flight. Cows will out pace you.  As soon as you break gait,  from walk to run they will too. Cows turn when you pass their shoulders when overtaking them. Closer to the animal the sharper the turn. Cows have little sense of time and have lots of patience,  you need to respect that.",
      "Mitchco - 12/20/2025  16:59 I was tagging a day old calf along a creek bank with some large rocks. Most of my cows are friendly enough I can walk up to them and scratch them. This cow was normally skittish around me. When I grabbed her calf it mooed bloody murder and that lit the cows fuse. She came after me with her head down balling. I saw her out of the corner of my eye and jumped up to run tripping on the rocks. She managed to pinch my thigh between her head and a rock. I was able to get away with only a little soreness in my leg and scraped hands from the rocks. I quit tagging calves after this. A year ago I had a calf with lung problems that died on me. By not tagging calves I lost track of how old this calf was. Because of white marks on this calf I figured out she was a dink. 2 1/2 years old and only 500 pounds. So I have gone back to tagging. My wife was helping me tag a calf from a first calf heifer this past summer. My wife bailed off the gator and pounced on the calf. The cow was 200 feet away. I jumped off with the tagger in hand but the cow beat me there. My wife let the calf go and started to back away just as the cow got there. I think my wife tripped, but she went down and did a backwards somersault. I'm not sure if the cow even made contact but it looked as if the cow knocked her over backwards. My wife was sore for a month. She now calls this cow \"steaks\". My dad always told me to never get close to a bull without a weapon. I've never had a problem with a bull. A maternial cow is much worse than a bull. Mitchco Bulls will hurt you.  Cows will kill you.",

      "This was 100% my own stupidity. This spring I had a first calf heifer straining to calve with huge hooves sticking out of her. Granted, I havenât had to pull a calf in 7 yearsâ¦ Itâs wide open out in the pasture and my cattle are very tame. I did have a portable corral set up but I was alone and didnât want to take the time to corral her. I go out there with the calving chains and get one on a hoof, the heifer stands up and Iâm trying to get the chain on the other hoof but the hoof slipped inside her so I go and make a loop on my hand so I can grab the hoof and slip the loop over. Well, the other cows are getting excited because itâs the first calf of the year, the heifer takes off running and the loop of chain tightens on my hand. Iâm running after her and slip and fall. I ended up getting pulled about 150 yards down a hill full of rocks, trees and little stumps, by my hand. As Iâm getting pulled Iâm trying to stay as low as possible so I donât get kicked in the head and Iâm thinking, âIm probably going to lose my hand.â Well, she finally got tired and stopped at the bottom of the hill so I got my hand out. Next, she walks to the top of the hill and lays down so I go up there and pull the calf. So as Iâm laying there, covered in manure with my clothes all torn up my wife came home and see the calf lying there gasping and is yelling at me to take care of the calfâ¦ So I stood up, covered with manure, my overalls and shirt all tore up and I told her that calf can die for all I care. Sheâs a city girl so her eyes about popped out of her head. The back of my hand was numb for a couple months and I have some scars on my side from getting dragged but otherwise all good. The calf was 104 pounds and both him and the heifer did just fine. My Dad used to buy West River cows at the local auction back in South Dakota but he stopped tha after reaching 70 years old and getting stomped into a snowbank by one of those doozies. Thankfully, one of his buddies who used to ranch was helping him and was able to get the cow off him with help from a pitchfork.",
      "Turns out the cow may be a Highlander bull. The file photo they used is probably what the weekend newsroom staff considers to be a cow. https://www.ctvnews.ca/barrie/article/kawartha-area-motorists-cautio... Provincial police are warning drivers and residents in the Kawartha Lakes area that a cow has been wandering freely in the area since Saturday night. In an early Sunday morning social media post, City of Kawartha Lakes OPP reported a loose cow roaming along Highway 35 in Cameron, and that it was possibly a highland bull. The OPP public information advisor (PIA ) told CTV News that the owner of the cow has been identified, but the cow has not been found yet. Drivers are urged to remain alert while driving in the area as the search remains ongoing. Anyone with information about the cow and its whereabouts is asked to come forward.",

      "I run hair sheep and they can be highly profitable if you commit to the right stocking rates to eliminate overheads (winter feeding. ) Everyone is different, and markets change but based on the current state of things is you run 2 ewes per acre and you wean 1.4 lambs apiece you are looking at selling 2.8 lambs â¦ X $160 per head = $448 return per acre which seems good to me, considering the very low inputs of hair sheep. Obviously the more inputs you want to add will decrease that final number.",
      "Could pairs graze in between rows of Christmas trees until they're ready for harvest? Might be some damage to the trees when they're little, but I've never seen a cow chewing on the conifers that grow around here. Might break branches off when they use them for scratching. What do you think? Anyone here have a Cut-Your-Own Christmas tree farm?",
      "My thoughts on pounding wood posts, most of the time here we are dry so we predrill. Took a 4\" auger and built up flighting to 5\" on thr bottom 1/2 of auger. Use that to predrill holes also bought an extension for auger so we can reach over fences to pre drill holes in an existing fence. We use 6\" wood posts here that are pointed and tapered. Also we run a 1000 Montana driver with a 2' factory extension bolted into it. It allows use to do 12' wood posts for wildlife. The upside of that extension is it the added weight. The added weight is a big key in sinking posts in our hard ground. I've watched a 750 Montana pound right next to mine and they struggle to drive posts with a NH tracked 332 Skidsteer. It would walk all over, just too light in my opinion. When we first got pounder ran it on a Case 95XT wheeled machine. Learned to set park brake while pounding and would run boom in float while pounding. Then went to Cat 255 tracked, felt it handled weight better, I still like to set park brake while pounding. I have a harder time setting Cat in float with the electric switches, my son no problem for them. One big difference in pounders is your cup your using in hammer. The 750 models only come with a flat cup. 1000 and 1500 machines come with a tapered and flat cup. Only time we use flat cup is when driving flat topped wood, otherwise the tapered cup helps center pipe, T posts, and the tapered wood posts. With all the added weight in our Montana driver we usually never have to hammer T-posts as they just push in. We usually use a Danuser T-3 T-post pounder when doing 1/2 mile or more of fence in T-posts. Biggest factor is the soil your trying to pound in, we've found its faster to pre-drill in hard ground than to beat machine and posts trying to drive in less than ideal conditions.",
      "Something like this. Maybe the cost of a quote to bulldoze burn and bury and use that for a refundable deposit. Neighbor gave his away and poor guy was trying to pull it over after he had removed all the siding with a 1/2 ton and it ruined his transmission.

      "Was helping dad work a set in a particularly poor set of pens on leased pasture and was pushing the cattle in while dad gave shots. had a high headed 500# heifer come back to the crowd gate in the bud box. She jumped from about 1-1/2 body lengths away and hit the gate on the latch end just after id closed and removed my hands from it. It happened so fast all I could do was turn my head to keep from taking the gate to the face.  Hit me square in the chest and left a vertical bruise the entire length of my torso. I was incredibly sore, but dont think I broke anything. Same lots, maybe the same year, we were working the cows. I was in the box with the cows because one old biddy was being stubborn about sticking her body across the alley entrance and blocking it. I moved from the gate end up toward the alley to push her back around. She circled and eased by me until her back legs were even with me and gave me a cheap \"love\" shot as she passed. Definitely broke a spur off my tibia on my left leg and her dew claw got me good enough to draw blood all the way across my right thigh and up to the love handle above my waist line. Luckily the landlord on that place is a really decent guy and agreed to upgrade the lots there. Now its a breeze working.",

Regular inspections and audits could help identify areas where farms are adopting more humane practices, allowing for targeted support and incentives to encourage further improvements. By adopting a risk-based approach, we can focus on high-risk farms first, ensuring that those most likely to benefit from improved living conditions receive priority attention.\n\nIt's also essential to consider the regional context and farm size when designing regulations.

It happened so fast all I could do was turn my head to keep from taking the gate to the face.  Hit me square in the chest and left a vertical bruise the entire length of my torso. I was incredibly sore, but dont think I broke anything. Same lots, maybe the same year, we were working the cows. I was in the box with the cows because one old biddy was being stubborn about sticking her body across the alley entrance and blocking it. I moved from the gate end up toward the alley to push her back around. She circled and eased by me until her back legs were even with me and gave me a cheap \"love\" shot as she passed. Definitely broke a spur off my tibia on my left leg and her dew claw got me good enough to draw blood all the way across my right thigh and up to the love handle above my waist line. Luckily the landlord on that place is a really decent guy and agreed to upgrade the lots there. Now its a breeze working.",

To ensure equitable access, the regulatory framework should prioritize education and support for small-scale farmers, particularly in developing countries where resources are scarce.

In many cases, these producers rely on antibiotics as a last resort due to limited access to veterinary care or alternative disease prevention methods. A well-designed vaccine program should not only address public health concerns but also provide incentives for farmers to adopt new practices that benefit both their livelihoods and animal health.\n\nIn terms of policy barriers, there are several factors at play. Firstly, the pharmaceutical industry's marketing influence can lead to resistance from policymakers who prioritize corporate interests over public health. Secondly, regulatory frameworks often lag behind scientific evidence on vaccine effectiveness, and thirdly, the complexity of implementing large-scale vaccination programs can be daunting for policymakers and farmers alike.\"",

Granted, I havenât had to pull a calf in 7 yearsâ¦ Itâs wide open out in the pasture and my cattle are very tame. I did have a portable corral set up but I was alone and didnât want to take the time to corral her. I go out there with the calving chains and get one on a hoof, the heifer stands up and Iâm trying to get the chain on the other hoof but the hoof slipped inside her so I go and make a loop on my hand so I can grab the hoof and slip the loop over. Well, the other cows are getting excited because itâs the first calf of the year, the heifer takes off running and the loop of chain tightens on my hand. Iâm running after her and slip and fall. I ended up getting pulled about 150 yards down a hill full of rocks, trees and little stumps, by my hand. As Iâm getting pulled Iâm trying to stay as low as possible so I donât get kicked in the head and Iâm thinking, âIm probably going to lose my hand.â Well, she finally got tired and stopped at the bottom of the hill so I got my hand out. Next, she walks to the top of the hill and lays down so I go up there and pull the calf. So as Iâm laying there, covered in manure with my clothes all torn up my wife came home and see the calf lying there gasping and is yelling at me to take care of the calfâ¦ So I stood up, covered with manure, my overalls and shirt all tore up and I told her that calf can die for all I care. Sheâs a city girl so her eyes about popped out of her head. The back of my hand was numb for a couple months and I have some scars on my side from getting dragged but otherwise all good. The calf was 104 pounds and both him and the heifer did just fine. My Dad used to buy West River cows at the local auction back in South Dakota but he stopped tha after reaching 70 years old and getting stomped into a snowbank by one of those doozies. Thankfully, one of his buddies who used to ranch was helping him and was able to get the cow off him with help from a pitchfork.",

I did have a portable corral set up but I was alone and didnât want to take the time to corral her. I go out there with the calving chains and get one on a hoof, the heifer stands up and Iâm trying to get the chain on the other hoof but the hoof slipped inside her so I go and make a loop on my hand so I can grab the hoof and slip the loop over. Well, the other cows are getting excited because itâs the first calf of the year, the heifer takes off running and the loop of chain tightens on my hand. Iâm running after her and slip and fall. I ended up getting pulled about 150 yards down a hill full of rocks, trees and little stumps, by my hand. As Iâm getting pulled Iâm trying to stay as low as possible so I donât get kicked in the head and Iâm thinking, âIm probably going to lose my hand.â Well, she finally got tired and stopped at the bottom of the hill so I got my hand out. Next, she walks to the top of the hill and lays down so I go up there and pull the calf. So as Iâm laying there, covered in manure with my clothes all torn up my wife came home and see the calf lying there gasping and is yelling at me to take care of the calfâ¦ So I stood up, covered with manure, my overalls and shirt all tore up and I told her that calf can die for all I care. Sheâs a city girl so her eyes about popped out of her head. The back of my hand was numb for a couple months and I have some scars on my side from getting dragged but otherwise all good. The calf was 104 pounds and both him and the heifer did just fine. My Dad used to buy West River cows at the local auction back in South Dakota but he stopped tha after reaching 70 years old and getting stomped into a snowbank by one of those doozies. Thankfully, one of his buddies who used to ranch was helping him and was able to get the cow off him with help from a pitchfork.",

Granted, I havenât had to pull a calf in 7 yearsâ¦ Itâs wide open out in the pasture and my cattle are very tame. I did have a portable corral set up but I was alone and didnât want to take the time to corral her. I go out there with the calving chains and get one on a hoof, the heifer stands up and Iâm trying to get the chain on the other hoof but the hoof slipped inside her so I go and make a loop on my hand so I can grab the hoof and slip the loop over. Well, the other cows are getting excited because itâs the first calf of the year, the heifer takes off running and the loop of chain tightens on my hand. Iâm running after her and slip and fall. I ended up getting pulled about 150 yards down a hill full of rocks, trees and little stumps, by my hand. As Iâm getting pulled Iâm trying to stay as low as possible so I donât get kicked in the head and Iâm thinking, âIm probably going to lose my hand.â Well, she finally got tired and stopped at the bottom of the hill so I got my hand out. Next, she walks to the top of the hill and lays down so I go up there and pull the calf. So as Iâm laying there, covered in manure with my clothes all torn up my wife came home and see the calf lying there gasping and is yelling at me to take care of the calfâ¦ So I stood up, covered with manure, my overalls and shirt all tore up and I told her that calf can die for all I care. Sheâs a city girl so her eyes about popped out of her head. The back of my hand was numb for a couple months and I have some scars on my side from getting dragged but otherwise all good. The calf was 104 pounds and both him and the heifer did just fine. My Dad used to buy West River cows at the local auction back in South Dakota but he stopped tha after reaching 70 years old and getting stomped into a snowbank by one of those doozies. Thankfully, one of his buddies who used to ranch was helping him and was able to get the cow off him with help from a pitchfork.",

I go out there with the calving chains and get one on a hoof, the heifer stands up and Iâm trying to get the chain on the other hoof but the hoof slipped inside her so I go and make a loop on my hand so I can grab the hoof and slip the loop over. Well, the other cows are getting excited because itâs the first calf of the year, the heifer takes off running and the loop of chain tightens on my hand. Iâm running after her and slip and fall. I ended up getting pulled about 150 yards down a hill full of rocks, trees and little stumps, by my hand. As Iâm getting pulled Iâm trying to stay as low as possible so I donât get kicked in the head and Iâm thinking, âIm probably going to lose my hand.â Well, she finally got tired and stopped at the bottom of the hill so I got my hand out. Next, she walks to the top of the hill and lays down so I go up there and pull the calf. So as Iâm laying there, covered in manure with my clothes all torn up my wife came home and see the calf lying there gasping and is yelling at me to take care of the calfâ¦ So I stood up, covered with manure, my overalls and shirt all tore up and I told her that calf can die for all I care. Sheâs a city girl so her eyes about popped out of her head. The back of my hand was numb for a couple months and I have some scars on my side from getting dragged but otherwise all good. The calf was 104 pounds and both him and the heifer did just fine. My Dad used to buy West River cows at the local auction back in South Dakota but he stopped tha after reaching 70 years old and getting stomped into a snowbank by one of those doozies. Thankfully, one of his buddies who used to ranch was helping him and was able to get the cow off him with help from a pitchfork.",

One area to consider is rotational grazing strategies, which may help break down some of the plant's fibers and make it more palatable. Additionally, feeding senne with animals that have been preconditioned or acclimated to its fiber content, such as cattle with access to other forages, could potentially ease the digestive burden on your herd. It's worth experimenting with these alternatives to see if they improve digestion and overall welfare for your dairy herd.",

Clear standards and verification protocols are essential in ensuring accountability and transparency in animal agriculture.\n\nWould you consider the following proposal: Establishing a voluntary certification program for premium pre-calving nutrition, with regular audits and inspection protocols to ensure compliance with established animal welfare standards?

Also we run a 1000 Montana driver with a 2' factory extension bolted into it. It allows use to do 12' wood posts for wildlife. The upside of that extension is it the added weight. The added weight is a big key in sinking posts in our hard ground. I've watched a 750 Montana pound right next to mine and they struggle to drive posts with a NH tracked 332 Skidsteer. It would walk all over, just too light in my opinion. When we first got pounder ran it on a Case 95XT wheeled machine. Learned to set park brake while pounding and would run boom in float while pounding. Then went to Cat 255 tracked, felt it handled weight better, I still like to set park brake while pounding. I have a harder time setting Cat in float with the electric switches, my son no problem for them. One big difference in pounders is your cup your using in hammer. The 750 models only come with a flat cup. 1000 and 1500 machines come with a tapered and flat cup. Only time we use flat cup is when driving flat topped wood, otherwise the tapered cup helps center pipe, T posts, and the tapered wood posts. With all the added weight in our Montana driver we usually never have to hammer T-posts as they just push in. We usually use a Danuser T-3 T-post pounder when doing 1/2 mile or more of fence in T-posts.

As a regulator, I can attest that both industry practices and regulatory measures play critical roles in mitigating this threat. While industry insiders may argue that their current practices are safe, the scientific consensus is clear: excessive use of antibiotics in agriculture contributes significantly to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.\n\nRegulators must take a proactive stance to prevent the spread of superbugs through strict guidelines on antibiotic use in agriculture. This includes implementing regulations on veterinary oversight, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms that ensure compliance with established standards. In this context, it's essential to prioritize risk management and adopt precautionary principles, even in the face of scientific uncertainty.\n\nThe question of responsibility is complex, but ultimately, both regulators and industry players share a critical role in protecting public health. As regulators, we must balance competing interests and ensure that regulations are not only effective but also implementable. This requires collaboration with industry stakeholders, farmers, and other relevant parties to develop and enforce policies that promote responsible antibiotic use.",

Also we run a 1000 Montana driver with a 2' factory extension bolted into it. It allows use to do 12' wood posts for wildlife. The upside of that extension is it the added weight.

I have a harder time setting Cat in float with the electric switches, my son no problem for them. One big difference in pounders is your cup your using in hammer.

As the precautionary principle suggests, we should act on risks even with scientific uncertainty, while also considering the potential economic implications for farmers. By working together, we can find solutions that prioritize both animal welfare and sustainable agricultural practices.",

As for working with cattle, my research focus has been on the intersection of antimicrobial resistance and livestock production.

Some studies suggest that these approaches may reduce stress-related illness and mortality rates, potentially leading to lower antibiotic use. However, the evidence on this topic remains limited, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n\nIn my work, I've come to appreciate the importance of considering multiple factors when exploring complex issues like antimicrobial resistance.

As for working with cattle, my research focus has been on the intersection of antimicrobial resistance and livestock production. I've explored how different farming systems, management practices, and antibiotic use patterns affect the emergence and spread of resistant bacteria in farm environments.\n\nWhile positive reinforcement techniques can be effective in improving animal welfare, particularly when applied to handling and training practices, their impact on antimicrobial resistance is less clear-cut. Some studies suggest that these approaches may reduce stress-related illness and mortality rates, potentially leading to lower antibiotic use. However, the evidence on this topic remains limited, and more research is needed to fully understand its effects.\n\nIn my work, I've come to appreciate the importance of considering multiple factors when exploring complex issues like antimicrobial resistance. It's essential to balance mechanistic understanding with empirical evidence, acknowledging both the benefits and limitations of various approaches. By doing so, we can strive for a more nuanced understanding of these pressing issues in animal agriculture.",

While some may argue that these operations are necessary for food security, I firmly believe that a balanced approach is required. On one hand, large-scale farms can contribute significantly to the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria through their extensive use of antibiotics. However, if done responsibly, they can also help drive innovation in animal welfare and sustainable farming practices.\n\nTo mitigate these risks, I propose that we prioritize robust regulations and enforcement mechanisms for these operations. This would include mandatory reporting systems, regular inspections, and clear standards for animal housing and treatment. Moreover, transparency and labeling requirements could be essential in empowering consumers to make informed choices about the dairy products they purchase. In fact, some countries like Denmark have already implemented successful labeling schemes, which have led to increased consumer demand for more sustainable and humane farming practices.\n\nHowever, it's crucial that we also acknowledge the challenges posed by large-scale industrial farms. These operations often face significant economic pressures, and regulatory compliance can be a burden on smaller-scale farmers. Therefore, it's essential",

To address this, I'd like to propose a risk-based regulatory approach that targets high-risk farming operations and emphasizes compliance monitoring and enforcement.\n\nRegulations should require farmers to implement measures to prevent cow damage to trees, such as rotational grazing systems and tree protection barriers. Mandatory reporting systems with clear verification protocols would help track compliance, while providing technical support for smaller operations during the transition period.\n\nAdditionally, the regulatory framework could prioritize antimicrobial resistance mitigation by promoting best management practices (BMPs) like antibiotic stewardship programs and manure management strategies that reduce soil contamination.",

The study's findings suggest that even with seemingly benign short-term grazing methods, there are still significant risks to tree health, emphasizing the need for robust regulation and enforcement.\n\nHow would you envision implementing these new guidelines, and what kind of support systems can be put in place for farmers transitioning to more sustainable practices?",

To mitigate these risks, regulatory frameworks should prioritize a precautionary approach, considering the potential unintended consequences of altering genetic material.\n\nIn line with this principle, our agency would advocate for mandatory reporting systems that track genetic modifications in livestock, ensuring transparency and monitoring capabilities to detect potential invasive gene introductions. Additionally, we would support research into the long-term effects of genetic selection on local ecosystems and animal populations, informing evidence-based policy decisions.\n\nTo strike a balance between promoting efficient farming practices and protecting biodiversity, we could explore alternative approaches that prioritize conservation-friendly genetic selection methods or focus on improving disease prevention through traditional breeding practices. By taking a risk-informed approach to genetic selection, we can minimize the potential harm to ecosystems while still supporting the agriculture industry's needs for efficiency and sustainability.\n\nWhat enforcement mechanisms would you propose to ensure compliance with these regulations?",

This cow was normally skittish around me. When I grabbed her calf it mooed bloody murder and that lit the cows fuse. She came after me with her head down balling. I saw her out of the corner of my eye and jumped up to run tripping on the rocks. She managed to pinch my thigh between her head and a rock. I was able to get away with only a little soreness in my leg and scraped hands from the rocks. I quit tagging calves after this. A year ago I had a calf with lung problems that died on me. By not tagging calves I lost track of how old this calf was. Because of white marks on this calf I figured out she was a dink. 2 1/2 years old and only 500 pounds. So I have gone back to tagging. My wife was helping me tag a calf from a first calf heifer this past summer. My wife bailed off the gator and pounced on the calf. The cow was 200 feet away. I jumped off with the tagger in hand but the cow beat me there. My wife let the calf go and started to back away just as the cow got there. I think my wife tripped, but she went down and did a backwards somersault. I'm not sure if the cow even made contact but it looked as if the cow knocked her over backwards. My wife was sore for a month. She now calls this cow \"steaks\". My dad always told me to never get close to a bull without a weapon. I've never had a problem with a bull. A maternial cow is much worse than a bull. Mitchco Bulls will hurt you.  Cows will kill you.",

This cow was normally skittish around me. When I grabbed her calf it mooed bloody murder and that lit the cows fuse. She came after me with her head down balling. I saw her out of the corner of my eye and jumped up to run tripping on the rocks. She managed to pinch my thigh between her head and a rock. I was able to get away with only a little soreness in my leg and scraped hands from the rocks. I quit tagging calves after this. A year ago I had a calf with lung problems that died on me. By not tagging calves I lost track of how old this calf was. Because of white marks on this calf I figured out she was a dink. 2 1/2 years old and only 500 pounds. So I have gone back to tagging. My wife was helping me tag a calf from a first calf heifer this past summer. My wife bailed off the gator and pounced on the calf. The cow was 200 feet away. I jumped off with the tagger in hand but the cow beat me there. My wife let the calf go and started to back away just as the cow got there. I think my wife tripped, but she went down and did a backwards somersault. I'm not sure if the cow even made contact but it looked as if the cow knocked her over backwards. My wife was sore for a month. She now calls this cow \"steaks\". My dad always told me to never get close to a bull without a weapon. I've never had a problem with a bull. A maternial cow is much worse than a bull. Mitchco Bulls will hurt you.  Cows will kill you.",

The OPP public information advisor (PIA ) told CTV News that the owner of the cow has been identified, but the cow has not been found yet. Drivers are urged to remain alert while driving in the area as the search remains ongoing. Anyone with information about the cow and its whereabouts is asked to come forward.",
            "output_text": "That's quite a sight! I can imagine the Highway 35 scene with a loose Highland bull - not something you see every day, that's for sure. I'm curious, have they considered using some kind of deterrent or containment method to safely recapture the cow? We've had similar issues on our farm before where a stray animal wandered into a field, and it was a real challenge to get it back out without stressing the animals.",

This creates an unwarranted fear of cow-borne disease and suggests that rotational grazing is not a viable option without strict measures to control grazing movements. The use of phrases like \"potential risks\" and \"compromise tree health\" contributes to this overcautious framing.",
